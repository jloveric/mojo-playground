# mojo-playground
Experimenting with the mojo language. The "Hello World" below just used mojo with python poetry and import
pytorch and creates a torch tensor. That's it.  Seems to work on ubuntu.

# Using

After installing mojo, run

```
poetry install
```
then
```
poetry shell
```
then
```
mojo main.mojo
```
