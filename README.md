# mojo-playground
Experimenting with the mojo language

# Using

After installing mojo, run

```
mojo main.mojo
```

## Notes from last check

- list comprehension not implemented
- can't seem to use torch (perhaps operator error)
- trying to use numpy (and poetry) conflicts with mojo version of numpy.

Seems like it needs to cook a bit more. I'll try again later!
